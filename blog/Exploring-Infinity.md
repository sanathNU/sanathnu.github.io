# Exploring the Infinite Libraries
> _This is the second post in a series documenting the conception and implementation of ಅಕ್ಷರ ಮಂಟಪ (Akshara-Mantapa), my attempt to build Borges' Library of Babel in Kannada. The series walks through philosophy, linguistics, mathematics, and engineering, in that order, mostly._

೧. [The Dream of Ananta](/blog/web/Ananta-Intro.html): why infinity, why Kannada

೨. **Exploring the Infinite Libraries**: You are here


೩. [Taming Infinity](/blog/web/Taming-Infinity.html): the mathematics of bijection

೪. [Engineering Infinity](/blog/web/Engineering-inf.html): Rust, WASM, and making it run

೫. [Reflections from Infinity](/blog/web/Reflections-inf.html): what I learned
