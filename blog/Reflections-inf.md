# Reflections from Infinity
> _This is the final post in a series on ಅಕ್ಷರ ಮಂಟಪ (Akshara-Mantapa), my Kannada implementation of Borges' Library of Babel. We've walked through philosophy, linguistics, mathematics, and engineering. Now: what did I actually learn from all this?_

**The Series:**

೧. [The Dream of Ananta](/blog/web/Ananta-Intro.html): why infinity, why Kannada

੨. [Exploring the Infinite Libraries](/blog/web/Exploring-Infinity.html): a hands-on guide to both libraries

೩. [Taming Infinity](/blog/web/Taming-Infinity.html): the mathematics of bijection

೪. [Engineering Infinity](/blog/web/Engineering-inf.html): Rust, WASM, and making it run

೫. **Reflections from Infinity**: You are here
