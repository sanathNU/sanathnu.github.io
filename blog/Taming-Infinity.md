# Taming Infinity
> _This is the third post in a series on ಅಕ್ಷರ ಮಂಟಪ (Akshara-Mantapa), my Kannada implementation of Borges' Library of Babel. We've covered the "why" and the "what." Now comes the "how": the mathematics that makes infinity navigable._

**The Series:**

೧. [The Dream of Ananta](/blog/web/Ananta-Intro.html): why infinity, why Kannada

೨. [Exploring the Infinite Libraries](/blog/web/Exploring-Infinity.html): a hands-on guide to both libraries

೩. **Taming Infinity**: You are here

೪. [Engineering Infinity](/blog/web/Engineering-inf.html): Rust, WASM, and making it run

೫. [Reflections from Infinity](/blog/web/Reflections-inf.html): what I learned
