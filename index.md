# About Me

<img src="/images/Sanath.jpeg" class="floatpic">

<br>
Hey! I'm **Sanath**.<br>

I'm currently a Masters Student in Computer Science at **[Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/)**.

Prior to this, I worked as a Cloud Engineer at **[Hewlett Packard Enterprise](https://www.hpe.com/in/en/home.html)**

If you are interested in working with me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at my [mail](sanathn.upadhyaya@gmail.com). You can see what I'm working on over at the [projects page](/projects/).

## Research Interests

**Current Research Focus:**
* Applying cryptographic protocols in distributed systems for enhanced data security and system resilience at scale.

**Previous Experience:**
* Interned at [IIT Dharwad](https://www.iitdh.ac.in/) under [Prof. Rajeshkar K](https://www.iitdh.ac.in/rajshekar.k/index.html), working on CPU instruction pipeline optimization.
* Gained foundation in system-level optimizations that I now apply to secure and resilient distributed infrastructures.

**Career Goal:**
* To work at the intersection of distributed systems and applied cryptography, building cloud-scale infrastructure that remains secure under failure, attack, and scale, turning cryptographic theory into deployable, systems-level guarantees rather than academic artifacts.
