## Research Interests

Previously, I interned in **[IIT Dharwad](https://www.iitdh.ac.in/)**, under **[Prof Rajeshkar K](https://www.iitdh.ac.in/rajshekar.k/index.html)** ,where I worked on optimizing CPU instruction pipeline. <br>

I currently focus on building secure scalable systems using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). To that end, I'm **[CKA](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/)/[CKS](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-security-specialist/)** certified. My research and my industry experience has taught me the importance of hardware acceleration, large scale distributed systems, and securing them.

This journey from hardware to large scale software has been a fascinating one, and I think I'm glad to see, the future is bright ahead.
