## Research Interests

At Northeastern University, I am currently researching the application of cryptographic protocols in distributed systems, focusing on enhancing data security and system resilience at scale.<br>


Earlier, I had the opportunity to intern at **[IIT Dharwad](https://www.iitdh.ac.in/)** under the mentorship of **[Prof Rajeshkar K](https://www.iitdh.ac.in/rajshekar.k/index.html)**, where I worked on optimizing CPU instruction pipelines. This experience helped me build a solid foundation in system-level optimizations, which I now apply to building more secure and resilient distributed infrastructures.<br>

Iâ€™m actively building expertise in securing distributed systems, with a goal to contribute to developing robust, high-performance, and secure infrastructures.
