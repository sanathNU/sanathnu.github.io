## Research Interests

- Post Quantum Cryptography
- Distributed Systems
- Artificial General Intelligence

I currently focus on building secure scalable systems using Kubernetes. I am **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)** Certified. My research and my industry experience has taught me the important of large scale distributed systems, and securing them. Previously, I interned in [IIT Dharwad](https://www.iitdh.ac.in/), under [Prof Rajeshkar K](https://www.iitdh.ac.in/rajshekar.k/index.html) ,where I worked on optimizing CPU instruction pipeline. <br> 
This journey from hardware to large scale software has been a fascinating one, and I think I'm glad to see, the future is bright ahead.
