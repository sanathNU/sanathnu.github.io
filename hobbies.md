# Hobbies

> To be is to learn.

## Books
I like books and how they positively influence the way I think. I my interests vary from science, to philosophy, to history, and on it goes. 

## Languages
I like learning new languages, and I'm a strong believer in the Weak **[Sapir Whorf Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity)**. How can one be bored, when one can learn the various pleasures of language?<br>
Anyways, I've been fairly interested in computational aspect of NLP for real languages and there's fascinating research on it. I speak Hindi, Kannada, a bit of German, and the world's language of choice, English.
