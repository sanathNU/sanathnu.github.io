## Projects

A collection of things I'm building or have built. I use these projects to learn, experiment, and solve problems I find interesting.

### Current Work

**Exploring Cryptography**
*   I'm planning on exploring and writing about CRYSTALS [Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/) and [CRYSTALS Dilithium](Dilithium), both Post Quantum Cryptographic Protocols based on Lattice Cryptography.

### Archived Projects

A list of projects I've worked on in the past.

*   **Customer Personality Analysis Project** - Analyzed customer data from Kaggle using clustering techniques (K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, DBSCAN) to segment personalities into Browsers, Aristocrats, and Need-Based customers, providing insights to optimize marketing strategies.
    *   **Technologies**: Numpy, Pandas, SMOTE Scikit-learn, Scipy

*   **Kannada MNIST Autoencoder Project** - Trained an Autoencoder on the Kannada handwriting dataset, testing different layer configurations to see what worked best for capturing the nuances in the data.  ([Notebook link](https://github.com/sanathNU/Kannada-MNIST-Autoencoder))
    *   **Technologies**: Tensorflow, PyTorch
