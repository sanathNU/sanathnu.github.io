## Projects

A collection of things I'm building or have built. I use these projects to learn, experiment, and solve problems I find interesting.

### Current Work

**Double Ratchet Algorithm · [GitHub](https://github.com/sanathNU/DoubleRatchetJava)**
* A Java implementation of Signal’s [Double Ratchet cryptographic protocol](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/) that generates a fresh encryption key for each message, providing forward secrecy and post-compromise security for asynchronous encrypted messaging. [Github Link]().

**Exploring Cryptography**
* Studying and documenting post-quantum cryptographic schemes, with a focus on lattice-based protocols including [CRYSTALS-Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/) and [CRYSTALS-Dilithium](https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/), emphasizing their design principles and practical implications.

### Archived Projects

A list of projects I've worked on in the past.

*   **Customer Personality Analysis Project** - Analyzed customer data from Kaggle using clustering techniques (K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, DBSCAN) to segment personalities into Browsers, Aristocrats, and Need-Based customers, providing insights to optimize marketing strategies.
    *   **Technologies**: Numpy, Pandas, SMOTE Scikit-learn, Scipy
<br> <br>

*   **Kannada MNIST Autoencoder Project** - Trained an Autoencoder on the Kannada handwriting dataset, testing different layer configurations to see what worked best for capturing the nuances in the data.  ([Notebook link](https://github.com/sanathNU/Kannada-MNIST-Autoencoder))
    *   **Technologies**: Tensorflow, PyTorch
